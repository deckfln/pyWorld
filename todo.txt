07/01/18: 31/12/17  THREEpy             when pickle loading THREE objects, be aware of the ID's
07/01/18: 30/12/17  THREEpy             pickle cache the loaders (like collada or OBJ)
08/01/18: 07/01/18  performance         move the tile streaming to an secondary process
08/01/18:           terrain             only hide a parent tile once the 4 sub tiles are loaded and ready to be displayed
          03/01/18  forest generation   trees should not be implemented on steep slopes
11/01/18: 08/01/18  performance         load tiles in order of distance
11/01/18: 08/01/18  terrain             during redraw, only hide a tile if all sub-tiles are loaded in memory
17/01/18: 30/12/17  player              get running move to work
17/01/18: 03/01/18  frustum culling     remove tiles outside of the frustum
17/01/18: 30/12/17  animation           use dedicated animation for the actor while running
25/01/18: 16/01/18  performance         replace scenaries merged mesh with instanced meshes: all instances have the same size
25/01/18: 24/01/18  scenery             display instance sceneries at different scale
27/01/18: 25/01/18  scenery             implement shadows on instances
27/01/18: 27/01/18  shadows             let the terrain cast shadows too
28/01/18: 30/12/17  player              actor should slide down a slope if it is steep
28/01/18: 25/01/18  lights              add ambient light
28/01/18: 03/01/18  shadows             get shadows to fade away from the source object
02/02/18: 28/01/18  camera              control camera is not working any more
03/02/18: 27/01/18  shadows             move the shadowmap center from the player object-> ahead of the player object (whats's behind the player is culled, so lost for the shadowmap)
08/02/18: 22/01/18  performance         merge instances of an object for all tiles on screen into a single drawcall, remove frustrum culling
08/02/18: 04/02/18  instances           set source object to unit 1 so it's easier to rescale at display
10/02/18: 24/01/18  scenery             use OBJ model do display scenery
18/02/18: 06/02/18  scenery             add grass instances
18/20/18: 18/02/18  grass               BUG: grass instances are generated on road
24/02/18: 18/02/18  scenery             add high grass and forest scenery to the instances
25/02/18: 18/02/18  scenery             use displacement map to distribute grass blades

01/03/18: 25/02/18  OO                  refactor Asset class

TODO: 28/01/18  player              when the player is sliding down a slope, turn the player along the normal of the slope
TODO: 28/01/18  shadows             Cast shadows for scenery outside of the frusturm AND outside of the shadow camera cone
TODO: 28/01/18  lights              implement lights in the shaders following UniformsLibs implementation

-- BUGS --
TODO: 17/01/18  collision           can be stuck in a tree
TODO: 17/01/18  camera              engine crash if camera if outside of the heightmap
TODO: 24/01/18  scenery             if the footprint of scenery is over multiple tiles, multiple meshes will be displayed. Meshes should only be displayed if center of the mesh is on the tile
TODO: 25/01/18  lod                 tiles on the edge of the screen are not displayed. scenery also disapear too often
TODO: 28/01/18  shadows             when the terrain cast AND receive shadows, sometime you see triangles or stripes
TODO: 03/02/18  shadows             if player is partily in the shadow of a tree, the shadow of the player is only partially visible.
                                    the shadow of the tree fade with distance to none but the player is still in the shadow of the tree so doesn't cast shadow by itself
TODO: 09/02/18  shadows             tree foliage transparency casts shadow
TODO: 10/02/18  lightning           instances objects lightning is wrong
TODO: 24/02/18  terrain             frustrum culling is visible on the edge
