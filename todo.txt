06/02/18: 29/04/18  terrain             stiching: use only one vertex out of 2 on a border if a tile touch a tile with lower resolution. Reindex vertex

22/06/18:           procedural scenery  reimplement the generation process. Fast and better
23/06/18: 26/06/18  scenery             lighting is wrong for some models because of normal vectors not normalized
24/06/18: 25/06/18  terrain shader      use only 1 image instead of 6 images for the terrain textures

-- BUGS --
TODO: 17/01/18  collision           can be stuck in a tree
TODO: 24/01/18  scenery             if the footprint of scenery is over multiple tiles, multiple meshes will be displayed. Meshes should only be displayed if center of the mesh is on the tile

TODO: 03/02/18  shadows             if player is partily in the shadow of a tree, the shadow of the player is only partially visible.
                                    the shadow of the tree fade with distance to none but the player is still in the shadow of the tree so doesn't cast shadow by itself
